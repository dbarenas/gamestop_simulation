# GameStop simulation — **async-ready, step-by-step instructions** (English)

Below is a concise, implementation-focused specification you can drop into an async code tool. It describes the **actors**, **state**, **events**, and a runnable **async pseudocode** sketch (Python `async/await` style). It’s intentionally procedural so an “async vibe” executor can spin up coroutines for each actor and a central market loop.

> **Goal:** simulate the GameStop (GME) short-squeeze pattern: retail buying → positive feedback → short covering → platform intervention → sharp reversion.
> **Outputs to record:** price time series, trade volume, short interest, P\&L by actor type, number of retail entrants over time, flag for platform restrictions.

# 1 — Key parameters (suggested defaults)

Use these as tunable knobs.

* `initial_price = 15.0` (USD)
* `float_shares = 70_000_000` (shares available)
* `short_interest_ratio = 1.2` (120% of float shorted) → `short_shares = float_shares * short_interest_ratio`
* `liquidity = 2_000_000` (shares; larger → less price move for same net demand)
* `price_impact_k = 0.0000008` (impact constant used in log-price model)
* `tick_duration = 1` (unit time, e.g., 1 minute)
* `simulation_ticks = 10_000` (run length)
* `retail_base_arrival_rate = 2.0` (expected buys per tick baseline)
* `media_amplification_factor = 3.0` (multiplier to retail rate when media hype is on)
* `hedge_cover_threshold_pct = 0.25` (hedges begin to cover after 25% loss of collateral)
* `platform_volatility_threshold = 0.35` (35% realized volatility over short window → restrict buys)
* `fomo_threshold_price_increase = 0.50` (50% price increase in short window triggers FOMO entry surge)

(These are **starting** values — tune to match the shape you want.)

---

# 2 — State variables (global / market)

* `price` (current market price)
* `available_float` (float\_shares)
* `short_shares` (how many shares are currently short)
* `outstanding_long_shares` (total longs; derived)
* `order_queue` (async queue of orders submitted this tick)
* `realized_volatility` (rolling volatility estimate)
* `buy_allowed` (bool; platform can set to False)
* `time` (tick counter)
* logs: `price_history`, `volume_history`, `short_interest_history`, `actor_pnl`

---

# 3 — Actors & behaviors (algorithmic rules)

### Hedge Fund (short sellers)

* **Initialization:** large short position `short_shares`. Short entry price = `initial_price`.
* **Behavior each tick:**

  * Monitor unrealized loss = `(current_price - short_entry_price) * short_shares`.
  * If loss fraction > `hedge_cover_threshold_pct` of collateral → start **covering** gradually (submit `buy_to_cover` orders).
  * Covering rate can be proportional to loss severity (e.g., cover X% of remaining short per tick).
  * Optionally use `stop-loss` or margin-call mechanic to force more aggressive covering.

### Retail cluster (many small buyers)

* **Baseline:** generate buy orders at Poisson(rate = `retail_base_arrival_rate`).
* **Momentum / FOMO:** if `price` has increased by > `fomo_threshold_price_increase` over recent window, multiply arrival rate by a factor (>1).
* **Coordinated surge (meme):** media or social triggers increase probability of large coordinated buy waves (many small buys within few ticks).
* **Profit taking:** each retail agent has a `take_profit_pct` and `stop_loss_pct`. Once satisfied, they submit sell orders.

### Options effect (optional)

* When call option buying is modeled, treat each option lot as `effective_leverage` → convert to delta-equivalent demand and inject it as extra buy volume near option expiry.

### Trading platform (e.g., Robinhood)

* **Monitoring:** compute short-window realized volatility (e.g., last 5–30 ticks).
* **Rule:** if `realized_volatility > platform_volatility_threshold` or margin/capital constraints > threshold → set `buy_allowed=False` (block new buy orders) for X ticks.
* **Effect:** only allow sell orders (liquidity drains), causing price fall.

### Media / Social aggregator

* **Trigger:** detects strong price momentum (slope > threshold) → sets `hype=True` for N ticks.
* **Effect:** multiplies retail arrival rate by `media_amplification_factor`.

### Regulator (optional)

* Can inject events like hearings, fines, or statements that dampen hype — modeled as `hype=False` or slight sell pressure.

# 4 — Market clearing & price impact model (rule)

Use a simple **log-price** impact model:

1. Collect net signed volume for the tick:
   `net_volume = total_buy_shares - total_sell_shares`
2. Convert to log-return:
   `log_return = price_impact_k * (net_volume / liquidity)`
3. Update price:
   `price = price * exp(log_return)`
4. Update `volume_history`, update `short_interest` if hedges covered, update `realized_volatility` using rolling window of returns.

This model produces multiplicative moves and scales sensibly with net volume.

---

# 5 — Step-by-step simulation sequence (ready for async implementation)

1. **Initialize** global state using parameters (price, float, short\_shares, queues, logs). Hedge funds hold `short_shares` with known entry price.
2. **Spawn coroutines** for: Market Engine, N Retail clusters (or a retail factory), HedgeFund(s), Platform controller, Media actor, optional Regulator.
3. **Tick loop (market engine):** for `tick in range(simulation_ticks)`:

   * Open a new tick window:

     * Wake actors and allow them to submit orders to `order_queue` (async).
   * Collect orders from `order_queue` until an internal cutoff (or gather for T ms).
   * Aggregate orders into `total_buy_shares` and `total_sell_shares`.
   * Apply **platform buy\_allowed** rule: drop/ignore buys if disabled.
   * Compute `net_volume` and update `price` via log-price model.
   * Execute matching: assign trades size to actors (for P\&L computation).
   * Update hedges: if hedges bought to cover, reduce `short_shares`.
   * Update `realized_volatility`, `short_interest_ratio`, logs.
   * Media/Platform actors evaluate and possibly change `hype` or `buy_allowed`.
4. **Termination & reporting:** after ticks done, compute actor P\&L summaries, plot `price_history`, `volume_history`, `short_interest_history`.

> The above is a **framework** — operational details (order matching fairness, partial fills, per-actor balances, margin mechanics) should be implemented per your tool’s capabilities.

# 7 — Tuning experiments (what to vary & why)

* **Short interest ratio:** ramp from 0.5 → 1.5; higher → stronger squeeze potential.
* **Retail arrival rate & media\_factor:** control how fast retail demand compounds.
* **Liquidity & `k`:** lower liquidity or higher `k` → more violent moves.
* **Platform restriction rule:** change volatility threshold and duration to see how intervention collapses price.
* **Hedge cover threshold:** lower threshold → hedges cover earlier (dampens squeeze).

---

# 8 — Metrics & visualization to produce

* Time series: `price_history`, `volume_history` (buys vs sells), `short_interest_history`.
* Actor P\&L heatmap (hedge vs retail over time).
* Event flags overlay (media hype on/off, platform buy\_allowed false).
* Distribution of retail entry times vs profit outcomes (to show early winners vs late losers).

---

# 9 — Notes, caveats & disclaimer

* This model is stylized and omits many real market mechanics (order book microstructure, hidden liquidity, option gamma dynamics in detail, margin lender behavior).
* Use it for **research / educational simulation only** — not financial advice.
* If you want, I can next: (a) provide a runnable, complete async Python file with bookkeeping (balances, partial fills, logging), or (b) convert this into a Jupyter notebook cell layout (Markdown + code) ready to paste. Tell me which one and I’ll output the full code file (synchronously, here in the chat).

---

If you want, I’ll immediately generate the **complete runnable async Python script** (with actor bookkeeping, CSV logging, and plotting hooks) formatted as a single file you can copy/paste into your async runner — no waiting required. Which output do you prefer: **(1) full runnable script**, **(2) notebook cells**, or **(3) keep as a specification**?
